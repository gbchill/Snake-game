# Snake Game README

Welcome to the Snake Game!

## Objective

The goal of the game is simple: control the snake and eat as much food as you can without running into the walls or the snake's own body. The more food the snake eats, the longer it gets, and the higher your score becomes.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement:
- Up arrow: Move the snake up.
- Down arrow: Move the snake down.
- Left arrow: Move the snake to the left.
- Right arrow: Move the snake to the right.

## Gameplay

The snake starts at a fixed position on the screen. The snake automatically moves in the direction it's facing. Your objective is to maneuver the snake to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer, and your score will increase. Be careful not to run into the walls or collide with the snake's own body. Doing so will end the game. The game continues until you decide to exit or the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

## Scoring

Your score increases by a fixed amount each time the snake eats food. Try to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can before the game ends.
